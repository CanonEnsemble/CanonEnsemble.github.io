Hi! I am Canon, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Alberta. Previously, I was a PIMS (Pacific Institute for Mathematical Sciences) postdoctoral fellow, and before that, a PhD student at Johns Hopkins University.

I am a condensed matter theorist interested in various many-body phenomena. In particular, my research focuses on topological states of matter, superconductivity, and physics in hyperbolic space.

This website is very much a work in progressâ€”please check back soon!
